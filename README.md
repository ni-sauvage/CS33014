# CS33014
## A repository for [Concurrent Systems I](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/David.Gregg/cs3014/) as taught by [Dr. David Gregg](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/David.Gregg/)

This repository consists mostly of sample exam solutions. 

### [Q1](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS33014/blob/master/csu33014-annual-q1/csu33014-annual-q1-code.c)
Q1 is nearly invariably on [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) and involves the vectorisation of several routines.

### [Q2](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS33014/blob/master/csu33014-annual-q2/csu33014-annual-q2-code.c)
Q2 deals with parellelisation more generally, utilising [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) along with SSE to get a speedup on a singular problem.

### [Data Structs](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS33014/tree/master/data_structs)
These are some basic data structures I created when I took CS22014 Systems Programming with templates given also by Dr. Gregg. These can be useful for speeding up Q2.

### [Past Exams](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS33014/tree/master/past_exams) 
These are my solutions for past pen and paper exam questions for this module.
